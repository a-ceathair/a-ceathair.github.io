<h1>A4 at EGU 2022</h1>

<p>The A4 &amp; Roadmap Team shows its current work at the largest European geoscience conference.</p>

<p>After three years the largest conference for geoscientists in Europe takes place at least partly as an in person format. The EGU 2022 in Vienna covers all topics describing our Earth System, be it atmospheric, oceanic or soil sciences. A4 and the Roadmap Team is part of multiple presentations and activities over the next days.</p>

<p>One presentation covers an overview on the reasons for sea level change on the Eastern Coast of North America (<a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-8674">doi</a>). We also show the drivers of heat and freshwater content changes in the North Atlantic (<a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-5025">doi</a>). Staying in the North Atlantic we demonstrate the challenges around reconciling the different source informing us about changes in the Atlantic Overturning Circulation (<a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-7698">doi</a>). But of course does the North Atlantic also influence Ireland and its surrounding seas. Here we take a look onto its effects and potential predictability for the Irish fishery sector (<a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-8491">doi</a>). Also we demonstrate the effect of the North Atlantic onto Ireland temperatures for the next decade (<a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-6767">doi</a>). From the Ocean to the Atmosphere we show that models have its deficiencies in representing the connections of these two systems (<a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-5377">doi</a>). In the upper Atmosphere we show on multiple time scales the variability of the jet stream over the last century (<a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-1309">doi</a>). And as the Ocean has an important influence onto the European continent, we investigates the connection between ocean temperatures and heat waves (<a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-1538">doi</a>).</p>

<p>Additionally, we are involved in the organisation of two sessions, on the understanding of ocean variability (<a href="https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU22/session/42182">schedule</a>) and the predictability on seasonal to decadal scales (<a href="https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU22/session/42604">schedule</a>). All in all it will be an exciting week, showing the many facets of our work.</p>
