<h1>Research cruise with the RSFW Atair</h1>

<p>A cruise with our research partners to the Irish shelf edge</p>

<p>During June 2021, André Düsterhus went together with scientists of the Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH), the University of Bremen and Hamburg on a research cruise to the Irish shelf edge. Here two moorings, measuring ocean parameters over depth up to over 4000 metre were recovered and replaced. Additionally multiple measurements where made during the trip to put these moorings into an overall context of the local environment.</p>

<p>This cruise and the time before and after was dominated by a strict test and quarantine regime to make such an endeavour possible in these times. The trip started with some mechanical troubles and so was shortened from  three weeks to two. Additionally, a winch added to the ship to make additional measurements to more than 2000 metre did not work as planned and so also the measurements during the ship time had to be replanned. Otherwise, the collection and redeployment of the moorings and other measurements went smoothly and so the cruise was still a success.</p>

<p>These measurements will be used to gain further insights into the strength and positioning of the European Slope Current. By international collaboration A4 is able to get more observational data as it would be possible otherwise. A very positive side effects are the exchange of ideas and experiences during these trips, strengthening the foundation of our research.</p>
